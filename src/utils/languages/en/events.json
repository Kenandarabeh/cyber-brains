The workshop was led by respected professors Fathi Ayada and Samai Lakhdar, with the attendance of Taibi Sofiane and Azzedine Ben Khadouma. The workshop was also visited by the Director of the Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences, Dr. Boudwaya Mabkhout, who honored us with his encouraging words about the Rising Media Club, provided support and motivation to its members, and appreciated their efforts. The workshop activities included advice from the respected professors and sharing their experience in this field. It included two aspects: a theoretical component that helped members acquire media terminology and guidance in radio and television presentation, and a practical component that involved direct application in news bulletin presentation, program hosting, and voice commentary. The workshop concluded with guidance from the professors, may Allah benefit us with their knowledge and grant them more excellence and brilliance."
